### What the data by states have to tell

There is a stark contrast in terms of the damages imposed to property and health by the events over the years. While fatalities are high due to events occuring in the western side, the damage to property and crops is more in the Eastern part of USA.

Simply, put the deadliest events occur in the west coast whereas the damage costs are more in the east coast as crops production is more here.
