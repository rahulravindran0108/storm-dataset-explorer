# STORM DATSET EXPLORER

You can find the applicaiton at [Application](https://github.com/rahulravindran0108/storm-dataset-explorer)

## Summary

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/rahulravindran0108/storm-dataset-explorer).

You can adjust date range and event types using control panel located on the left side. Filtered dataset can be downloaded using data tab.

The application is primarily designed to tell the story oh how different events have caused loss of damage to population and economy in USA. It depicts this story with the help of the various maps and other interactive graphs.

## Design

- Included an about tab to give a brief description as to what the application is doing.
- Used the maps package to provide a better interative graph showing the damage weather events did to respective states
- I received feedback for improving on the filters. The first iteration did not use filters and simply plotted the maps and graphs. Therefore, in order to better describe it according to the user, I defined all the events that the user could use to show the effect of only those pertaining to their choices.
- Included stacked graphs to suite the user needs.

## Feedback

- Include an about section to understand what the application is about.
- Include line graphs to explain population and economic impacts.
- provide options to view as stacked graphs for better visualisation.
- use soft colour which include shades of blue to explain in detail what the events do.
